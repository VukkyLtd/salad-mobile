## FAQ

### Are there advertisements?
No. There is no reason for me to implement them, and implemeting them would probably make Salad very very angry at me.

### Does this literally just load up [app.salad.io](https://app.salad.io)?
Yes. That's exactly what it does.

#### Then why did you even bother making it?
Honestly, it wasn't that hard. This is still better than what we had before, which was nothing.
Sure, you could load up [app.salad.io](https://app.salad.io) in your phone's web browser, but the Salad team already attempted killing it off by adding the "Device not supported" message.

### Apple devices when?
No. I don't want to pay $99 for something like this. Thank you for your understanding.

### Can I mine on my mobile device?
No. That's not profitable at all.
