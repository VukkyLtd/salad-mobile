## FAQ

### Are there advertisements?
No. There is no reason for me to implement them.

#### Will you add advertisements?
Also no. Doing so will probably make Salad very very angry at me.

### Does this literally just load up [app.salad.io](https://app.salad.io)?
Yes. That's exactly what it does.

#### Then why did you even bother making it?
Honestly, it wasn't that hard.

### Apple devices when?
No. I don't want to pay $99 for something like this. Thank you for your understanding.

### Can I mine on my mobile device?
No. That's not profitable at all.
